<label>So this is how i play minesweeper, most of it i learned of google but i still decided to write it here, first select a random box and hope for it to not be a mine, continue until you click a numberless box so more boxes are revealed, then when playing its not in a strict order just remember the game the way works (every box has a number, the number is how many  mines are around that box) and before you click a box, remember to double check if any other box could have any information about that box just so you can be safe. And thats all. Hope this helped your minesweeping!</label>
